// Len is the length of time to sleep


/* This function works by mainting a delta list. This is where
   each element in the list has as its key a value that is its difference
   from the previous value. For example if we had the values 3, 7, 8, and 15 
   to put in a list a list with their actual values would look like:
       3->7->8->15   As a delta list this would be stored as:
       3->4->1->7    To get the value of a node we sum all the preceding 
                     values along with the value in that node. If these 
   values represent how long into the future to sleep then all we have to do
   is decrement the value of the head of the list on each tick. When that value
   gets to 0 the time has expired and we remove it from the list. The value 
   value of the element now at the head of the list represents how much 
   additional time has to elapse before that time expires.
